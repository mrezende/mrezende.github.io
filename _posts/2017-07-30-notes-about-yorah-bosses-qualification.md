Yorah Bosse's qualification has a lot of questions, but for me the main question she is trying to answer is *what are the most common errors that students are committing when they are trying to learn how to program*.

If she could find an reasonable answer for that question, it will be much easier to develop tools or create teaching methods to help students to learn how to program.

But how sure is she that learning how to program is difficult? She answered these question analyzing the percentage of reproved students on introduction to program discipline of University of Sao Paulo. The percentage of reproved students are 30%. What are the percentage of another disciplines? And about biology, human, engineer and medicine courses?

She has tried to answer analyzing 5 year's data of students from USP (University of Sao Paulo). And about private universities? Is there any correlation between socioeconomic status and the student's grade?

I made some questions, but I think it is not her goal to find answer to all of them. But it is very interesting how further we can go when we talk about learning difficulties. And, of course, there are a lot of researchers who answered or is trying to answer my questions.

She is doing a lot of things to find the difficulty pattern in learning how to program. First, she has made interviews to ask students what are the common difficulties they have when they are learning how to program. She asked teachers what are the common difficulties they see on students when they are teaching them how to program.

After that, she gave a lecture of 8 weeks for some students with poor grade. The main goal of this lecture was to help them and increase their grades. She gave a introduction to program course at summer school and she collected some codes from students. She will analyze those codes and try to find the most common student's error.

And another thing, she has collected 40000 codes of students from University of Sao Paulo and she will develop a system to analyze all of them and try to find some patterns of difficulties.

So, the Yorah Bosse's research is very interesting and has a lot of paths she could follow. But she found a interesting path and it will be very interesting if she could find a reasonable answer for it. I would like to see what are the most common student's errors when they are learning how to program. It will help me a lot as a teacher.
