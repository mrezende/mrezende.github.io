Bianca Santana's research focused on difficulties of learning how to program. It presents a deep research about the motivations, difficulties of students when they are trying to learn how to program. Its research focused on non-majors students, students who are not from IT area. Then, accordingly to the research, non-majors difficulties and motivations are different from IT students.

As a result of exploratorium study of the difficulties and motivations of non-majors students, its research proposes a new approach for teachers who are giving a introduction to program lecture. Then, its new approach proposes programming language, tools and methodologies for teachers. Those programming languages, tools and methodologies were already applied on some universities accordingly to the research.

According to the research, there are five motivation's types: extrinsic, intrinsic, social, realization and null. Extrinsic motivation is driven by external rewards like career, salary. Intrinsic motivation is driven by internal rewards, there is no obvious external rewards. It seems a simple enjoyable activity. Social motivation is driven by a feeling of pleasuring someone else. Null motivation is no motivation at all.

So, it is very difficult to find a intrinsic motivation for learning how to program for non-majors students. As a consequence, the rate of reproved non-majors students are higher than IT students according to the research. Then, it proposes a new approach for introduction to programming lectures to increase non-majors student's motivation and decreases the percentage of reproved ones.

These approach is composed by three parts: Scratch, Python with Turtle and JES.

Scratch is a visual tool created for students who would like to learn how to program. It allows the students focus on solving logical problems, instead of worrying about syntax code errors. Python is a programming language which syntax is simpler than C++ or Java and it is used by most of tech companies like Google or Facebook. As a consequence, it will increase the motivation of students, as long as they will learn a language it is useful.

Turtle is a library created for students draw geometric pictures with a few commands. The students has learned Turtle library with Scratch tool. So, students had focused only in Python's syntax to learn Turtle, as long as the commands are the same.

The last part is JES. JES is a tool created by Georgia Tech for supporting a computer media course. JES has a lot of features to help students work with images and videos. According to the research, working with medias increases the student's motivation, provided that images and videos are part of most student's daily basis life. Some students has said they talked to their relatives about what they were learning, it indicates an increase in importance of the course.

The results of the new approach for non-majors introduction program course has showed a little increase of student's motivation in the end. The students motivations had decreased on the end of second part and last part. As reported by the research, the last part was the most difficult for the students, they couldn't understand vectors and matrix very well. And professor couldn't get theirs attentions, some students complained about the examples which were very tough. Another students complained about professor who wasn't familiar with JES and some students had to help him.

Some researches had proposed new approaches for non-majors introduction to programming course, but Bianca's research went further proposing a new approach based on past researches and applying a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results. The results weren't so good and the research's goal is not clear in the end.

The theoretical part is a great contribution from Bianca's research to everyone who would like to understand the difficulties and approaches which were applied by others researchers.
