Bianca Santana's research focused on difficulties of learning how to program. It presents a deep research about the motivations, difficulties of students when they are trying to learn how to program. Its research focused on non-majors students, students who are not from IT area. Then, accordingly to the research, non-majors difficulties and motivations are different from IT students.

As a result of exploratorium study of the difficulties and motivations of non-majors students, its research proposes a new approach for teachers who are giving a introduction to program lecture. Then, its new approach proposes programming language, tools and methodologies for teachers. Those programming languages, tools and methodologies were already applied on some universities accordingly to the research.

According to the research, there are five motivation's types: extrinsic, intrinsic, social, realization and null. Extrinsic motivation is driven by external rewards like career, salary. Intrinsic motivation is driven by internal rewards, there is no obvious external rewards. It seems a simple enjoyable activity. Social motivation is driven by a feeling of pleasuring someone else. Null motivation is no motivation at all.

So, it is very difficult to find a intrinsic motivation for learning how to program for non-majors students. As a consequence, the rate of reproved non-majors students are higher than IT students according to the research. Then, it proposes a new approach for introduction to programming lectures to increase non-majors student's motivation.

These approach is composed by three parts: Scratch, Python with Turtle and JES.

Scratch is a visual tool created for students who would like to learn how to program. It allows the students focus on solving logical problems, instead of worrying about syntax code errors. Python is a programming language which syntax is simpler than C++ or Java and it is used by most of tech companies like Google or Facebook. As a consequence, it will increase the motivation of students, as long as they will learn a language it is useful.

Turtle is a library created for students draw geometric pictures with a few commands.
