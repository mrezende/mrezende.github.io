My name is Marcelo de Rezende Martins, I'm a sofware engineer at FAPESP, a public foundation at Sao Paulo, Brazil, which supports research projects in higher education and research institutions. I'm finishing my master's degree at IPT on machine learning and NLP. Now, I'm interested in math and machine learning and how we could apply those knowledge in our daily basis. Apart from that, I like running, reading books and eat pa√ßoca (brazilian candy).
